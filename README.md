# Project Name: C Language

#### Who am I?

Hello. I am Alp. I am studying Information Security Technology at Ondokuz Mayis University. 

#### What's the purpose of repo ?
I am repeating the information I learned at school. Here I will collect the programs I made starting from scratch with C. In this way, I will both repeat myself and create a resource for friends who do not know C.

#### Others notes
* While preparing this study, I benefited from the [BTK Academy's course](https://www.btkakademi.gov.tr/portal/course/c-programlama-dili-26686). Apart from this course, I also included some of the work we do at school. 
* I don't speak English very well, and I'm trying to improve myself in that direction, so I'm trying to bring it into every aspect of my life. Forgive me if I make mistakes.
* This repo will be continuously updated.
* It is a repo open to every development. For major changes I would appreciate if you contact me first. Feel free to tell me if I'm wrong. Thank you very much.
